. *The immediate effect of a 1 unit increase in gmwage on gwage 232 is estimated to b
> e .1504. The immediate effect is statistically significant even at the 1% level, si

. *Part ii
. *The predicted one-period lagged effect is estimated to be -.0035. The one-period l
> agged effect is not statistically significant at any of the standard signficance le
> vels. The p-value on the estimated one-period lagged effect is .714, which implies 
> that there is a 71.4% chance of observing a statistic at least as extreme as -.0035
> , and therefore the gmwage_1 is not very statistically significant.

. *We use the lincom command to do a point estimate of the sum of coefficients on gmw
> age and gmwage_1. The resulting variable will have a coefficient of delta0 + delta1
> , which is the long-run effect of a one unit permanent increase in gmwage starting 
> at time t.
. *We obtain a coefficient of .1468, which implies that a 1 unit increase in gmwage s
> tarting at time t generates a .1468 unit change in gmwage232 (holding all other fac
> tors constant and interpreting in a causal manner.)
. *The coefficient on the newly defined variable is statistically significant even at
>  the 1% level, because it has a p-value = 0 < .01.
