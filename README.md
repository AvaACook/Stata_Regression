# Stata_Regression
Regression on small datasets in Stata

- Utilized ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) linear regression to create predictive models
- Analyzed two datasets: 1) Housing and 2) Minimum wage and unemployment
- Interpreted results using causal and noncausal lenses

I performed this analysis for Introductory Econometrics, which I took in Fall 2022.
This course focused on the statistical principles of econometrics and utilized Stata for larger computations.
